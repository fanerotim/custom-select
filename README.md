Prototype of a custom select. I needed to build one for my Quotes React App, but decided to first work on a protopate in Vanilla JS / Typescript and then work on implementing it in my React app.

Styling is extremely basic, but the goal was to work on implementation and functionality. I may come back to style this one to make it pretty though.
